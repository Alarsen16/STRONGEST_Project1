# Microsoft Movie Recommendation
## Overview
We have been given many different data sets including:
* imdb ratings
* rotten tomatoes
* various reviews
* movie budgets

We're going to go through these data sets in order to have a better understanding of what factors are important in making a successful movie.

## Business Understanding
Microsoft has created a new movie studio and they wish to know what type of films to create
* Which genre is most popular?
* Does runtime matter?
* Which director produces consistently popular movies?

Our goal after taking a deep dive into the data is to be able to provide Microsoft with some strategies for their filmmaking process so that they can maximize profits while reducing risk

As we can see by these graphs if there is a bigger budget there is a bigger return on investment.

In general film runtime doesn't have a large effect on the rating, however a longer movie has slightly higher ratings

Rated R movies have the highest potential for profits, however PG-13 movies are consistently profitable.

Buena Vista, Warner Bros. and Universal Studios are leading the industry so it's important to look into what they're doing correctly

## Conclusion
After analyzing the data, we recommend that Microsoft takes the following approaches when producing their own movie
* Have a large enough budget
* Make sure the movie is long enough to tell the story necessary
* Aim for a pg-13 rating
These strategies will reduce risk and maximize potential profits.
