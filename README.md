# Microsoft Movie Recommendation
## Overview
We have been given many different data sets including
* imdb ratings
* rotten tomatoes
* various reviews
* movie budget

We're going to go through these data sets in order to have a better understanding of what factors are important in making a successful movie.
## Business Understanding
Microsoft has created a new movie studio and they wish to know what type of films to create
* Which genre is most popular?
* Does runtime matter?
* Which director produces consistently popular movies?

## Conclusion
We recommend that Microsoft takes the following approaches when producing their own movie
