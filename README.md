# Microsoft Movie Recommendation

## Overview

Microsoft has approached us for recommendations on how they should approach stepping into the movie industry. We've analyzed various data sets (listed below) and will describe our findings and final recommendations throughout this document.  

Data Sets:
* imdb ratings
* rotten tomatoes
* various reviews
* movie budgets

## Business Understanding

We'll be looking to answer the following questions to help us better understand the layout of the movie industry. This will help us provide clear and succicnt guidance for Microsoft's movie endeavor. 

* Are there genres more popular than others?
* Does runtime matter?
* Is there a rating that outperforms others?
* Is there any correlation between net profit and budget?

As we can see by these graphs if there is a bigger budget there is a bigger return on investment.

In general film runtime doesn't have a large effect on the rating, however a longer movie has slightly higher ratings

Rated R movies have the highest potential for profits, however PG-13 movies are consistently profitable.

Buena Vista, Warner Bros. and Universal Studios are leading the industry so it's important to look into what they're doing correctly

## Conclusion
After analyzing the data, we recommend that Microsoft takes the following approaches when producing their own movie
* Have a large enough budget
* Make sure the movie is long enough to tell the story necessary
* Aim for a pg-13 rating
These strategies will reduce risk and maximize potential profits.
